I have a strong interest in text sentiment analysis, particularly in its applications within social media and news domains. Text data from these areas reflects real-time societal dynamics and public emotions, offering a unique perspective for studying opinion trends and sentiment dissemination. I specialize in leveraging natural language processing techniques, such as sentiment classification, topic modeling, and time-series analysis, to extract emotional insights from text. By employing tools like BERT models and visualization techniques, I analyze how sentiments evolve with time, events, and topics. Through research on sentiment distribution in social media posts and news reports, I aim to provide data-driven support for brand management, public opinion monitoring, and so on.
